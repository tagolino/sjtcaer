>> Brian: So go to your Details page,
>> Brian: And we're gonna import Carousel from ./Carousel.

>> Brian: So import Carousel at the top, on line 27 grab media out of this.state. And then, again, this is coming from the API, if you remember. And then here, on line 31, be out of the Carousel component with media=media that we got from the API.
>> Brian: And that should be enough, now you should see a nice looking Carousel when you go to your page.

[00:01:14]
So let's go take a look,
>> Brian: Aw, look at that pup. And so now you can click on both of these, right? And it'll change which image you're looking at.
>> Brian: I just wanna pet that dog, that's all I wanna do right now.
>> Brian: Well, we have gotten up to another Commit point here.
