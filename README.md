## NOTES:

```
1. class component
2. functional component
     - good, easy to test, easy to predict,  has less overhead as opposed to classes (Rob)
     - pure vs impure functions? (Rob)

- classes should only be used if you're dealing with stateful components
- functional can do stateful now
- useEffect

- hook
- context


- but, hooking the context, makes the code less complicate
```
