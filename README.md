#### Tools

```
- NPM and generating a package.json file
     > Node Package Manager
     > This is going to allow us to, rather than just loading node off of the CDN,
       we're gonna actually install it off of the registry and build our project.
       So that it's actually included with the package, and we don't have to rely on unpackage to be up, right?"
     > Unpackage is really good for just like testing things out. But do not rely on it
       for production traffic, cuz then you're at their mercy, okay?
- Prettier
- NPM scripts
- Prettier setup
- ESlint setup
- ESlint configuration
- gitignore
- Parcel
- Installing React and ReactDOM
- Separate App into Modules
```

## NOTES:

```
1. class component
2. functional component
     - good, easy to test, easy to predict,  has less overhead as opposed to classes (Rob)
     - pure vs impure functions? (Rob)

- classes should only be used if you're dealing with stateful components
- functional can do stateful now
- useEffect

- hook
- context


- but, hooking the context, makes the code less complicate
```
